# This is a placeholder for the Tall Bookshelf 3D model
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary GLB file
# The model should include:
# - Main frame (separate mesh)
# - Shelves (separate meshes for each shelf)
# - Back panel (separate mesh)
# - PBR materials: wood texture with grain details
# - Dimensions: ~0.8m wide, 0.3m deep, 2.0m high
# - Optimized for web: <6k polygons
