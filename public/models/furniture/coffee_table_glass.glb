# This is a placeholder for the Glass Coffee Table 3D model
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary GLB file
# The model should include:
# - Glass top (separate mesh with transparency)
# - Metal frame (separate mesh)
# - PBR materials: clear glass with reflections, brushed metal
# - Dimensions: ~1.2m wide, 0.6m deep, 0.4m high
# - Optimized for web: <5k polygons
