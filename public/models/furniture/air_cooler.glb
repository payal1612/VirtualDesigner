# This is a placeholder for the Air Cooler 3D model
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary GLB file
# The model should include:
# - Main body (separate mesh)
# - Fan blades (separate mesh for rotation animation)
# - Front grill (separate mesh)
# - Control panel (separate mesh)
# - PBR materials: plastic body, metal grill, rubber base
# - Dimensions: ~0.4m wide, 0.3m deep, 1.5m high
# - Optimized for web: <8k polygons
