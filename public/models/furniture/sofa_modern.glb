# This is a placeholder for the Modern Sofa 3D model
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary GLB file
# The model should include:
# - Sofa frame (separate mesh)
# - Cushions (separate meshes for each cushion)
# - Foldable bed mechanism (separate mesh)
# - PBR materials: fabric texture for cushions, wood/metal for frame
# - Dimensions: ~2m wide, 0.8m deep, 0.9m high
# - Optimized for web: <15k polygons
