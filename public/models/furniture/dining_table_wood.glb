# This is a placeholder for the Wooden Dining Table 3D model
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary GLB file
# The model should include:
# - Table top (separate mesh with wood texture)
# - Legs (separate meshes, metallic material)
# - PBR materials: polished wood surface, brushed metal legs
# - Dimensions: ~1.8m wide, 0.9m deep, 0.75m high
# - Optimized for web: <10k polygons
