# This is a placeholder for the Modern Refrigerator 3D model
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary GLB file
# The model should include:
# - Main body (separate mesh)
# - Doors (separate meshes for animation)
# - Interior shelves (separate meshes)
# - Handle (separate mesh)
# - PBR materials: metallic finish, plastic interior
# - Dimensions: ~0.6m wide, 0.6m deep, 1.8m high
# - Optimized for web: <20k polygons
